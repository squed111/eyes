# Eye Movement Excercise

Project Description:<br>
This project sets up to eyes, in which the pupils of the eyes follow the movement of the mouse.  It showcases the skills of build the eyes in CSS, and using a For Loop to make the eyes move together.

How to run:<br>
Pull the three parts of the code (html, js, and css) and get them into one file.  The code should run as soon as html is loaded onto browser.  To see the code in action you ca also go to squed.guthub.io/eyes.html.

Future Improvements:<br>
I would like to add an iris around the pupil to make the eyes a little more realistic.  I would also like to add eyelids to the eyes so that they close when the mouse goes below the screen boundaries.
